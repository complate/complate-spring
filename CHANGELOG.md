## [Unreleased]


## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-01

This release requires Spring Boot 3.0.x as baseline, which results into the
following breaking changes:

- This library is now build with JDK 17 which means the application needs to be
  build with at least JDK 17, too.
- This library now dependens on the Servlet API within the jakarta namespace
  which requires the application to depent on this, too.

Additionally the `complate-core` is updated to version `1.0.0` which was split
into separate modules for supported engines. This means you need to declare an
explicit dependency on the engine (currently Graal or Nashorn) that you want to
use.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade `complate-core` to 1.0.0
- Upgrade JDK baseline to 17 (latest baseline of Spring Boot 3.0.x)
- Upgrade Spring Framework to 6.0.x (latest baseline of Spring Boot 3.0.x)
- Upgrade Servlet API to jakarta namespace and version 6 (latest baseline of Spring Boot 3.0.x)

## [0.6.0] - 2020-01-06

This release is the successor of the last
[complate-spring-mvc](https://github.com/complate/complate-spring-mvc) release.

It contains a few breaking changes that you will need to change when upgrading:

1. The `groupId` changed from `com.github.complate` to `org.complate`.
2. The parameter order of the JavaScript render method changed to
   `stream, view, params`.
3. The `ViewResolver` changed from `com.github.complate.ComplateViewResolver` to
   `org.complate.spring.mvc.ComplateViewResolver`.
4. The `com.github.complate.ScriptingEngine` changed to
   `org.complate.core.ComplateRenderer`.
5. The `com.github.complate.NashornScriptingBridge` changed to
   `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`.
6. Instead of using Spring's `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` directly you
   need to use `org.complate.spring.source.ResourceComplateSource`.

If you rely on the previous behaviour that your JavaScript file is read on every
request you further need to wrap `org.complate.nashorn.NashornComplateRenderer`
within a `org.complate.core.renderer.ComplateReEvaluatingRenderer`. This may be
slower than before (because the `ScriptingEngine` is then recreated on every
request) but for production usage without wrapping the performance should be
increased.

### üì£ Notes
- `groupId` changed to `org.complate` ([e8d3123](https://github.com/complate/complate-spring/commit/e8d3123877be40c6b4c4a6c6a23acffd4cf8965a)).
- Multiple breaking changes as described above. Most introduced within the
  `complate-core` dependency.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New Features
- JavaScript file can be read only once which enhances performance.

### üìî Documentation
- A minimal configuration is shown in the readme.

### üî® Dependency Upgrades
- Upgrade to Spring Framework 5.1.2 (baseline of Spring Boot 2.1.0.RELEASE)
- Upgrade to Servlet 4.0.1 (baseline of Spring Boot 2.1.0.RELEASE)
